	- When searching for [Chorus] tag, just search for the words, because some of them are like 		[Chorus/Drop], etc. as long as it has the word [chorus]
- preview
	- each person has 1 try (don't disconnect if wrong because others can still guess) 
- [All commands] At the end of each game, print out each person who participated, how many attempts they took
- [All commands] Solo and multiplayer -  hangman sort of game (more visual)
