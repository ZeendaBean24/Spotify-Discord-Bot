# Spotify Chef Bot

*A school assignment turned into a passion project.*

## Introduction

Spotify Chef Bot is a versatile Discord bot designed to enhance your music experience by integrating Spotify's rich library directly within Discord. It allows users to interact with various Spotify features through simple commands. This project was initiated as part of a school assignment *(IB Coding MYP Unit)* but quickly turned into a passion project due to my interest in both music and coding.

## Features

Spotify Chef Bot offers a wide range of functionalities to **make music fun again**:

- **Game Features**: Includes music trivia games and guessing games that utilize Spotify tracks.
- **Social Features**: Allows users to share what they are listening to and discover new music through friends.
- **Playlist Manipulation**: View, analyze, and discover Spotify playlists.
- **Music Suggestions**: Based on blends, the bot suggests tracks across multiple playlists.

## Commands

The bot supports several commands to make music interaction fun and easy:

- `!recent`: Displays the most recent track played by the user on Spotify.
- `!genres`: Shows the top genres in a Spotify playlist selected by the user.
- `!popularity`: Analyzes the popularity of a Spotify playlist.
- `!randomsong`: Picks and plays a random song from a selected Spotify playlist.
- `!guess`: Starts a guessing game based on an album cover.
- `!preview`: Starts a guessing game based on a song audio snippet.
- `!blend`: Creates a blend of 50 tracks from user's playlists.
- `!top`: Displays the top users by coins earned in bot games.
- `!uses`: Displays the top users by command uses.

## Setup and Installation

As of now, Spotify Chef Bot runs locally and is not hosted on a server. Plans to deploy it on a server for permanent, continuous running are underway.

To set up the bot locally:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Ensure you have Python installed, along with `discord.py`,`spotipy`, and other dependencies *(Lines 1-4 in chef.py)*.
3. Set up your `.env` file with the necessary API keys and tokens from Discord and Spotify.
4. Run the bot using `python bot.py` from your command line.

## Version/Release History

- **1.0 (April 13, 2024)**: Initial release with full Spotify integration and basic game functionalities.

## Future Plans

Further enhancements will focus on expanding the bot's capabilities, including more interactive games, deeper Spotify integration, and possibly features integrating other music streaming services.
